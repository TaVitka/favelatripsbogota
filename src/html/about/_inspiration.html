      The inspiration behind starting Favela Trips Bogota came from a desire to change perceptions and highlight the
      positive aspects of favela life. The founders envisioned tours that not only showcase the culture and history of
      these neighborhoods but also empower and support local residents. Their vision is to offer tours that are
      respectful, educational, and impactful, leaving a lasting impression on all who participate.
