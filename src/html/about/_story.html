            Favela Trips Bogota was founded in 2018 by a group of passionate locals who wanted to share the hidden gems
            of their city with the world. They saw the potential to create meaningful connections between visitors and
            the vibrant communities within Bogota's favelas. Starting with just a few tours, the company quickly grew as
            word spread about the unique and authentic experiences they offered. Through dedication and a deep respect
            for the local culture, the founders built a company that prioritizes both education and sustainability.
            Today, Favela Trips Bogota is a trusted name in responsible tourism, known for its commitment to the
            community and enriching travel experiences.
