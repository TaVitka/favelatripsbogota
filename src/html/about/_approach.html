        Community Partnerships
      </h3>

      <div class="info__texts">
        <p>
          We have established partnerships with various community organizations within the favelas to support local
          initiatives. These partnerships ensure that a portion of our proceeds goes directly back into the community,
          funding projects such as educational programs and infrastructure improvements.
