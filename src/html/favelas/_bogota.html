          <p>
            The favelas of Bogota are vibrant and dynamic communities that embody the spirit and resilience of their
            residents. Originating from a need for affordable housing and often built on the city's periphery, these
            neighborhoods have grown into significant cultural hubs. Each favela has its own unique history and
            character, contributing to the rich tapestry of Bogota's urban landscape. The favelas are known for their
            strong sense of community, creativity, and resourcefulness, with local residents continuously working to
            improve their living conditions and celebrate their cultural heritage.
